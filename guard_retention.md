- Creating an initial stickiness
  - Create some connection w/ the opponent
    - Trap a leg
    - Grab a wrist
  - Allows to follow movements of opponent to keep him in front
- Prevent opponent from getting past the legs
  - Getting past the hip line
  - Guard is not lost when opponent is past the legs but it is a more dangerous situation
- Prevent opponent form controling the head
  - Shoulder control goes along with head control
  - Use frames to keep opponent from away from head/shoulders
  - Trust the frames and work to slide knees back between self and opponent
