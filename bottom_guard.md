- Keys:
  1. Opponents *elbow* inside your hip
  2. Contol opponents head
- 2-on-1 grip only works on beginner level
  - control wrist and elbow of one of opponents arms with both arms
  - problem: no head control
- Head control
  - pull head as low as possible (towards opponents elbow)
- Get opponents elbow as far to the opposite side as possible
  - Minimum: elbow across hip
  - Better: elbow to center line
  - Ideally: elbow over center line
- Thow up "top lock"
  - left leg on opponents shoulder
  - right leg high under opponents arm
- Recipe:
  1. Arm to centerline
  2. Control head
  3. Small angle with hips
  4. Throw legs up for "top lock"
    - Result: Opponent elbow inside hip
  5. Pivot to >=90 degree angle
    - Grab opponents leg w/ right arm

## Random points
- Closed guard is upside-down mount
  - Look for sweeps when opponent is off-balance
- When opponent plants a foot w/o controling the arm/wrist on that side
  - Grab ankle, sweep to opposite site
- Opponent plants both feet standing up
  - Grab both ankles, push opponent straight back
