Jiu Jitsu can be described as a system with 4 steps:

1. Take the opponent to the ground
   - The ground takes explosive force out of the fighting equation
2. Get past the legs
   - Legs are strong and dangerous
3. Move through a series of pins to a controlling position
4. Execute a submission

This framework does not naturally allow for leg attacks, as it is an upwards moving system.
The goal is always to get past the legs towards the head of the opponent to secure attacks
on the arms or the head. Thus leg locks were seen as a last resort in case of failure.
